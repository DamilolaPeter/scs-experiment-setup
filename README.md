# SCS experiment setup

A setup guide to run the [scs_predictive_analysis](https://github.com/AllisonOge/scs_predictive_analysis) project.

## Quick Start
This setup can be ran in github codespaces or on your local machine.

### GitHub Codespaces
- start a codespace

### Local Machine
The requirements for this setup is Docker so be sure to install it from the official [site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) before proceeding with the next steps.

- clone this repository
- build the dockerfile
- run a container

The docker images used in the dockerfile are large files and so the build may take some time. Be patient!
